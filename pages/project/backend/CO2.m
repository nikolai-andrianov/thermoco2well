classdef CO2
    % CO2 Calculate thermodynamic equlibrium and transport properties of
    %   carbon dioxide in the fluid region.
    %
    % The functions in this class are based on scientific publications,
    % which are listed a bit further down. If you use this code, make sure
    % to cite these publications accordingly. These papers also contain
    % further information on equations, such as the validity range.

    % Phase boundaries and virial coefficients as a function of temperature
    % in K
    %   melting pressure pMelt in MPa
    %   sublimation pressure pSub in MPa
    %   vapor pressure pVap in MPa
    %   saturated liquid density rhoLiqSat in kg/m^3
    %   saturated vapor density rhoVapSat in kg/m^3
    %   second virial coefficient B in m^3/kg
    %   third virial coefficient C in (m^3/kg)^2 
    % Phase boundary functions return nan outside their validity range. The
    % validity range is not checked for the virial coefficients.
    %
    % Equilibrium properties can be calculated in two ways: 
    % 1) as a function of density in kg/m^3 and temperature in K
    %   e.g. entropy = CO2.s_rhoT(density, temperature)
    % 2) as a function of pressure in MPa and temperature in K
    %   e.g. entropy = CO2.s_pT(pressure, temperature)
    % The inputs must have the same size or one of them has to be a scalar.
    %
    % Equilibrium properties:
    %   pressure p in MPa
    %   density rho in kg/m^3
    %   entropy s in kJ/(kg K) 
    %   internal energy u in kJ/kg
    %   isochoric heat capacity cv in kJ/(kg K)
    %   enthalpy h in kJ/kg 
    %   isobaric heat capacity cp in kJ/(kg K) 
    %   saturated liquid heat capacity cs in kJ/(kg K) 
    %   speed of sound w in m/s 
    %   Joule-Thomson coefficient mu in K/MPa 
    %   fugacity coefficient f
    %
    % Transport properties have to be calculated both at once, since they
    % depend on each other in the critical region. Just as with equilibrium
    % properties, they can be calculated in two ways: 
    % 1) as function of density in  kg/m3 and temperature in K
    %   [mu, lambda] = CO2.transport_rhoT(density, temperature)
    % 2) as a function of pressure in MPa and temperature in K
    %   [mu, lambda] = CO2.transport_pT(pressure, temperature)
    %
    % Transport properties:
    %   viscosity mu in mPa s
    %   thermal conductivity lambda in mW/(m K)

    % +++ Implementation notes +++
    % 
    % The validity range of the equations is not checked automatically.
    % At low temperatures/high pressures, you might have to check for the
    % solid region.
    % Only the *_rhoT functions identify values in the two-phase region and
    % return nan. If this check is not required the internal functions
    % *_rhoT_i can be used. The internal functions will return arbitrary
    % values in the two-phase region and they always return column vectors
    % regarless of the input dimensions.
    %
    % The *_pT functions first compute the density with an iterative
    % algorithm and then the requested property with the corresponding
    % *_rhoT function. If more than one property is computed at the same
    % p-T conditions, it is more efficient to compute the density
    % explicitly with the rho_pT function and then use the *_rhoT 
    % functions.
    %
    % The calculation of the transport properties uses values from the
    % equation of state by Span et al. (1994). Unfortunately, this EOS
    % shows some unphysical behavior in close vicinty of the critical
    % point. Specifically, there is a "dent" in the critical peak (see 
    % Figure 15 in Span et al. (1994) and also Figure 14 and 16 in Huber et
    % al. (2016)). 
    % Huber et al. propose to use the scaled equation by Albright et al. in
    % the region 303.1282 < T/K < 305.1282 and 350 < rho/(kg/m³) < 530 if 
    % highly accurate results are required.
    %
    % For the transport properties two variants are implemented. The 
    % up-to-date one, based on the work of Huber et al. (2016), Laesecke et
    % al. (2017) and Luettmer-Strahtmann (1995), which should be equivalent
    % to the implementation in Refprop 10. The depreciated one, based on 
    % Vesovic et al. (1990) and Fenghour et. al (1997), which should be 
    % equivalent to Refprop 7.
    % More information is included in the comments of the transport_rhoT_i
    % function.
